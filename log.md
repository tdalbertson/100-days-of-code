# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 11, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Worked a bit more on my check splitter app.

**Thoughts:** I think I'm getting the hang out of input validation in Python. Once I finish the command line version I'll move onto a GUI driven version. I'm thinking of using Tkinter or wxPython. I'll also continue learning Python through Udemy and Team Treehouse.

### Day 2: October 12, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Didn't get to code much today since I had to work late.

**Thoughts:** However, I was able to study and learn a few new things.
              For example, I learned a bit more in C++ about arrays and the "range-based for loop" that iterates once for each element in an array. 
              I was able to test a small example through an online C++ compiler.
              **The sytax: for (dataType rangeVariable : array)**
                            **statement;**                      
              I also reviewed some more things about Python and continued my Python Udemy course.
              **Quick Update!**
              I noticed I didn't like typing each git command to push changes in my project so I made a shell script to do it for me. It also gathers the user's comment before pushing!

### Day 3: October 13, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Learned more about C++ and Python

**Thoughts:**: Continued learning more about C++ arrays, especially that there aren't predefined checks in accessing memory outside of that set for arrays. I also decided to learn about Pygame. Starting a tutorial to recreate flappy bird using Pygame.
