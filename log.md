# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 11, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Worked a bit more on my check splitter app.

**Thoughts:** I think I'm getting the hang out of input validation in Python. Once I finish the command line version I'll move onto a GUI driven version. I'm thinking of using Tkinter or wxPython. I'll also continue learning Python through Udemy and Team Treehouse.
