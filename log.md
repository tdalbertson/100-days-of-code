# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 11, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Worked a bit more on my check splitter app.

**Thoughts:** I think I'm getting the hang out of input validation in Python. Once I finish the command line version I'll move onto a GUI driven version. I'm thinking of using Tkinter or wxPython. I'll also continue learning Python through Udemy and Team Treehouse.

### Day 2: October 12, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Didn't get to code much today since I had to work late.

**Thoughts:** However, I was able to study and learn a few new things.
              For example, I learned a bit more in C++ about arrays and the "range-based for loop" that iterates once for each element in an array. 
              I was able to test a small example through an online C++ compiler.
              **The sytax: for (dataType rangeVariable : array)**
                            **statement;**                      
              I also reviewed some more things about Python and continued my Python Udemy course.
              **Quick Update!**
              I noticed I didn't like typing each git command to push changes in my project so I made a shell script to do it for me. It also gathers the user's comment before pushing!

### Day 3: October 13, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Learned more about C++ and Python

**Thoughts:** Continued learning more about C++ arrays, especially that there aren't predefined checks in accessing memory outside of that set for arrays. I also decided to learn about Pygame. Starting a tutorial to recreate flappy bird using Pygame.

### Day 4: October 14, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: More studying C++ and Python as well as dabbling in Pygame

**Thoughts:** Continued learning more about C++ and Python. Learned some cool ways of accessing dictionary keys and values as well as tuple elements within a list using for loops and unpacking. Also decided to dabble in pygame a bit - had to figure out how to install it on my mac since the usual pip install command wasn't working. Also helped out a friend with their own pygame code since they were having issues.

### Day 5: October 15, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Focused mainly on Python today

**Thoughts:** Python continues to capture my attention - I don't know what it is exactly. I worked more with Pygame and created a repo for Flappy Bird in Python. Side note, it's crazy that the original game was released 7 years ago! I also learned about the enumerate and zip functions, as well as some methods from the rand module. I also read a bit more about C++ and hope to start building a project soon!

### Day 6: October 16, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: More Python

**Thoughts:** Studied more Python and completed the Python Statements challenge in the Python Udemy course I've been following. List comprehension and flattened for loops are so interesting - I hope I can implement them more in my own code. I also worked a bit more on my Flappy Bird Python clone.

### Day 7: October 17, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: C++ Focus

**Thoughts:** Focused completely on C++ today and learned more about arrays, accessing array data using for loops, learning about multi-dimensional arrays, and vectors. Multi-dimensional arrays are really interesting but took me a bit more time to understand. I'll be working on the next coding lab for my C++ class and upload it soon.

### Day 8: October 18, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: More C++

**Thoughts:** Finished my reading about arrays and vectors in C++. Multi-dimensional arrays still intimidate me so I'll need to do some more studying on them. I also aim to start looking at some frameworks for C++ to start doing more projects outside of the class for school. On a side note, I also added a scrolling floor to the Python Flappy Bird game.

### Day 9: October 19, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: APIs

**Thoughts:** Found an interesting beginner video course to APIs and started watching it today. Didn't actually code with any APIs but glad to know more about what they are and what they do. Worked on my lab assignemnt for my C++ class. The lab doesn't seem too difficult, it's just requires using arrays which is something I'm not 100% comfortable with yet.

### Day 10: October 20, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Arrays and vectors

**Thoughts:** Worked solely on my C++ assignment. Been running into various syntax and logical errors when using arrays and vectors. Despite this, I'm close to finishing this assignment. I plan on finishing this assignment tomorrow.

### Day 11 & 12: October 21 & 22, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Stuck on assignment

**Thoughts:** Continued working on my assignment for my C++ class. I've been stuck trying to get my program to display certain things correctly and haven't figured it out yet. I'll just keep at it.

### Day 13: October 23, 20202

**Today's Progress**: Finished program!

**Thoughts:** I FINALLY figured out the bugs in my C++ class assignment and turned it in. It felt so rewarding figuring out the issues and having the program work correctly. This is the kind of stuff I really love about programming. I also studied a bit on sorting algorithms and a little bit of Python.

### Day 14 & 15: October 24 & 25, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Algorithms

**Thoughts:** Been studying about different searching and sorting algorithms and big O notation (still don't fully understand it). I've been watching a lot of videos on each of these algorithms to fully get them down. I still need to finish reading this chapter to test my understanding then start on the coding assignment. 

### Day 16: October 26, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: More Algorithms!

**Thoughts:** Continuing to study search and sort functions. They way they work is really interesting to me, but I still don't know how to directly apply them in code. I'll continue to study these more in depth.

### Day 17: October 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: C++ Lab

**Thoughts** Finally completed the C++ Lab on algorithms. Although I understand the logic I can't code the algorithms from memory. I'll work on Python stuff tomorrow.

### Day 18: October 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: C++ Pointers

**Thoughts** Read and watched some videos on C++ pointers and how they work. However, I still don't quite understand their usage in programs or why they would be used over references. I'll keep looking into these things.

### Day 19: November 8th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: C++ Pointers are hard...

**Thoughts** I haven't been keeping up with this log since I've been studying about pointers in C++. To be honest, they're the most challenging programming concept (so far) for me to understand. Because of this, they're intimidating and I haven't gotten around to the programming assignment that requires them...

### Day 20: November 9th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Python Challenges

**Thoughts** Jumped back on Python today and have been completing the function practice problems for a Udemy course I am taking and went over lists again with Team Treehouse's Python Course.

### Day 21: November 10th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Python Challenges Continued

**Thoughts** Continued working on the function challenges from a Udemy course I'm taking. I had to reference the solutions video for a few of them but was able to solve most of them on my own. I was even able to solve one of the challenge problems in a completely different way than the solutions video!

### Day 22: November 21st, 2020

**Today's Progress**: New Experiences & Catching Up

**Thoughts** I realize I haven't been keeping up on this log although I've still been studying. Aside from this, I had my first experience with a small coding challenge during an interview. Despite not thinking I did very well it was a very eye-opening experience; it really showed me how much work I have to do. However, I was able to complete the challenge afterwords and will post my solution soon!

### Day 23: November 22nd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Object Oriented Programming

**Thoughts** Diving into Object Oriented Programming in C++. Although I understand the general idea of it, I need to reread the textbook's chapter on OOP to really get down the concepts and syntax.
