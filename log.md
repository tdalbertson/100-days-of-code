# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 11, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Worked a bit more on my check splitter app.

**Thoughts:** I think I'm getting the hang out of input validation in Python. Once I finish the command line version I'll move onto a GUI driven version. I'm thinking of using Tkinter or wxPython. I'll also continue learning Python through Udemy and Team Treehouse.

### Day 2: October 12, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Didn't get to code much today since I had to work late.

**Thoughts:** However, I was able to study and learn a few new things.
              For example, I learned a bit more in C++ about arrays and the "range-based for loop" that iterates once for each element in an array. 
              I was able to test a small example through an online C++ compiler.
              **The sytax: for (dataType rangeVariable : array)**
                            **statement;**                      
              I also reviewed some more things about Python and continued my Python Udemy course.
              **Quick Update!**
              I noticed I didn't like typing each git command to push changes in my project so I made a shell script to do it for me. It also gathers the user's comment before pushing!

### Day 3: October 13, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Learned more about C++ and Python

**Thoughts:** Continued learning more about C++ arrays, especially that there aren't predefined checks in accessing memory outside of that set for arrays. I also decided to learn about Pygame. Starting a tutorial to recreate flappy bird using Pygame.

### Day 4: October 14, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: More studying C++ and Python as well as dabbling in Pygame

**Thoughts:** Continued learning more about C++ and Python. Learned some cool ways of accessing dictionary keys and values as well as tuple elements within a list using for loops and unpacking. Also decided to dabble in pygame a bit - had to figure out how to install it on my mac since the usual pip install command wasn't working. Also helped out a friend with their own pygame code since they were having issues.

### Day 5: October 15, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Focused mainly on Python today

**Thoughts:** Python continues to capture my attention - I don't know what it is exactly. I worked more with Pygame and created a repo for Flappy Bird in Python. Side note, it's crazy that the original game was released 7 years ago! I also learned about the enumerate and zip functions, as well as some methods from the rand module. I also read a bit more about C++ and hope to start building a project soon!

### Day 6: October 16, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: More Python

**Thoughts:** Studied more Python and completed the Python Statements challenge in the Python Udemy course I've been following. List comprehension and flattened for loops are so interesting - I hope I can implement them more in my own code. I also worked a bit more on my Flappy Bird Python clone.

### Day 7: October 17, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: C++ Focus

**Thoughts:** Focused completely on C++ today and learned more about arrays, accessing array data using for loops, learning about multi-dimensional arrays, and vectors. Multi-dimensional arrays are really interesting but took me a bit more time to understand. I'll be working on the next coding lab for my C++ class and upload it soon.

### Day 8: October 18, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: More C++

**Thoughts:** Finished my reading about arrays and vectors in C++. Multi-dimensional arrays still intimidate me so I'll need to do some more studying on them. I also aim to start looking at some frameworks for C++ to start doing more projects outside of the class for school. On a side note, I also added a scrolling floor to the Python Flappy Bird game.

### Day 9: October 19, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: APIs

**Thoughts:** Found an interesting beginner video course to APIs and started watching it today. Didn't actually code with any APIs but glad to know more about what they are and what they do. Worked on my lab assignemnt for my C++ class. The lab doesn't seem too difficult, it's just requires using arrays which is something I'm not 100% comfortable with yet.

### Day 10: October 20, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Arrays and vectors

**Thoughts:** Worked solely on my C++ assignment. Been running into various syntax and logical errors when using arrays and vectors. Despite this, I'm close to finishing this assignment. I plan on finishing this assignment tomorrow.

### Day 11 & 12: October 21 & 22, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Stuck on assignment

**Thoughts:** Continued working on my assignment for my C++ class. I've been stuck trying to get my program to display certain things correctly and haven't figured it out yet. I'll just keep at it.
